# Veritas Implementation Summary

## Completed Features (Session Update)

### 1. Admin Access Control ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/app/manage/[id]/page.tsx`

- Added wallet verification before allowing access to management page
- Checks if `poll.admin` matches connected `publicKey`
- Shows "Access Denied" card with both wallet addresses for non-admins
- Provides "View Poll Instead" button for unauthorized users

**Implementation:**
```typescript
if (poll.admin.toString() !== publicKey.toString()) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center p-4">
      <Card className="max-w-md">
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>Access Denied</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription>Only the poll admin can manage this poll</CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        {/* Shows both admin and user wallet addresses */}
      </Card>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Tally & Publish Functionality ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/app/manage/[id]/page.tsx`

- Added encryption key upload (JSON file, 32-byte array)
- Fetches all VoterRegistry PDAs for the poll using `getProgramAccounts`
- Decrypts each vote using TweetNaCl (Curve25519-XSalsa20-Poly1305)
- Tallies votes by candidate name
- Displays results in UI with vote counts
- Auto-publishes to blockchain via `publishResults` mutation
- Only shows after voting period ends (`Date.now() > endDate`)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleTallyAndPublish = async () => {
  // 1. Fetch all VoterRegistry accounts for this poll
  const accounts = await connection.getProgramAccounts(program.programId, {
    filters: [{ memcmp: { offset: 8, bytes: pollId.toString() } }],
  })

  // 2. Decrypt each vote
  for (const account of accounts) {
    const voterData = program.coder.accounts.decode('VoterRegistry', account.account.data)
    // Extract: ephemeralPublicKey (32) + nonce (24) + ciphertext
    // Decrypt using nacl.box
  }

  // 3. Tally results
  const voteCounts = { /* candidate: count */ }

  // 4. Display results
  setTallyResults(results)

  // 5. Auto-publish to blockchain
  await publishResults.mutateAsync({ pollId, results })
}
```

**UI Components:**
- File input for encryption key upload
- "Tally & Publish Results" button (disabled until key uploaded)
- Loading state: "Decrypting & Publishing..."
- Results table showing candidate names and vote counts
- Success message: "Results Published to Blockchain ‚úì"

### 3. Audit Page Rewrite ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/app/audit/page.tsx`

- Removed all fake mock data and event generation logic
- Added educational content explaining blockchain events
- Included code snippets from `lib.rs` showing `emit!()` calls
- Added Solscan tutorial: step-by-step guide to viewing transaction logs
- Removed all emojis (as per user preference)
- Explained all four event types with code examples

**Event Documentation:**

1. **PollCreatedEvent**: Emitted in `initialize_poll` instruction
   - Contains: `poll_id`, `poll_name`, `admin`, `candidates`, `voting_start`, `voting_end`

2. **VoterRegisteredEvent**: Emitted in `register_voter` instruction
   - Contains: `poll_id`, `voter`

3. **VoteCastEvent**: Emitted in `vote` instruction
   - Contains: `poll_id`, `voter`

4. **ResultsPublishedEvent**: Emitted in `publish_results` instruction
   - Contains: `poll_id`, `results` (array of `CandidateResult`)

**Solscan Tutorial Sections:**
1. Get transaction signature from app
2. Open Solscan and switch cluster
3. Search for transaction
4. View "Program Instruction Logs"
5. Decode base64-encoded event data using Anchor IDL

**Programmatic Parsing Example:**
```typescript
const signatures = await connection.getSignaturesForAddress(PROGRAM_ID);
const transactions = await connection.getParsedTransactions(signatures);
// Parse logs to extract events...
```

### 4. Results Display (Already Implemented) ‚úÖ
**File:** `src/app/poll/[id]/page.tsx`

The poll page already had complete logic for displaying published results:

- Checks if `votingEnded && results` using `useResults(pollId)` hook
- Displays results table with:
  - Candidate names sorted by vote count
  - Vote percentages and vote counts
  - Visual progress bars
  - Medal icons for top 3 candidates (ü•áü•àü•â)
  - Total votes count
- Hides voting UI after results are published
- Shows "You voted in this poll" message if user participated

**Conditional Rendering:**
```typescript
if (votingEnded && results) {
  return (
    // Results display with sorted candidates
    {results.results
      .sort((a, b) => Number(b.voteCount) - Number(a.voteCount))
      .map((result, index) => (
        // Candidate result card with progress bar
      ))}
  )
}
```

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `tweetnacl` - Already imported, added to manage page for decryption
- `bn.js` - Dynamically imported for BN conversion in publishResults

### Hook Usage
- `useVotingProgram()` - Returns `program`, `publishResults`, `getVoterRegistryPDA`
- `usePoll(pollId)` - Fetches poll account data
- `useResults(pollId)` - Fetches results account (if published)

### PDA Derivations
- VoterRegistry: `[b"voter", poll_id, voter_pubkey]`
- Results: `[b"results", poll_id]`

### Encryption Format (TweetNaCl)
```
[ephemeralPublicKey (32 bytes)] + [nonce (24 bytes)] + [ciphertext]
```

### Decryption Process
1. Extract ephemeralPublicKey, nonce, ciphertext from Buffer
2. Compute shared secret: `nacl.box.before(ephemeralPublicKey, encryptionKey)`
3. Decrypt: `nacl.box.open.after(ciphertext, nonce, sharedSecret)`
4. Decode: `new TextDecoder().decode(decrypted)` ‚Üí candidate name

## Trust Model Documentation

### Current Implementation
- **Client-side decryption**: Poll admin uploads encryption key and decrypts votes locally
- **Trust assumption**: Admin is trusted not to manipulate tallying process
- **Blockchain immutability**: Encrypted votes cannot be tampered with on-chain
- **Transparency**: All events (registration, votes, results) are recorded permanently

### Future Enhancements
- **Zero-knowledge proofs**: Prove correct tallying without revealing individual votes
- **Homomorphic encryption**: Tally votes without decryption (like Helios voting system)
- **Threshold encryption**: Require multiple parties to decrypt results
- **Multi-party computation**: Distribute tallying across untrusted nodes

---

## Testing Checklist

### End-to-End Flow
1. ‚úÖ Create poll (shows correct incremented poll ID)
2. ‚úÖ Register voters via CSV or manual entry
3. ‚úÖ Voters cast encrypted votes
4. ‚úÖ Admin access control prevents unauthorized management
5. ‚è≥ Admin tallies and publishes results after voting ends
6. ‚è≥ Published results display on poll page
7. ‚úÖ All events recorded on blockchain (viewable via Solscan)

### Edge Cases
- ‚úÖ Non-admin cannot access `/manage/[id]` (shows Access Denied)
- ‚úÖ Tally button only appears after voting ends
- ‚úÖ Cannot tally without uploading encryption key
- ‚úÖ Already voted users cannot vote again
- ‚úÖ Non-registered users cannot vote
- ‚è≥ Results display correctly with vote counts and percentages

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Filter limitation**: `getProgramAccounts` with `memcmp` on poll_id may need adjustment
   - Poll ID is u64 (8 bytes), offset calculation must account for discriminator + padding
   - May need to test with actual account layout

2. **No pagination**: Fetches all VoterRegistry accounts at once
   - Could be slow for polls with thousands of voters
   - Consider adding pagination in production

3. **No progress indicator**: Decryption happens synchronously
   - Could add progress bar for large batches
   - Consider web workers for non-blocking decryption

4. **BN.js dynamic import**: Using async import for BN constructor
   - Could add to package.json dependencies if needed frequently

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Create a new poll with short time window (5-10 minutes)
2. Register 2-3 test voters
3. Cast votes from different wallets
4. Wait for voting to end
5. Upload encryption key to `/manage/[poll_id]`
6. Click "Tally & Publish Results"
7. Verify results display correctly
8. Check Solscan for published ResultsPublishedEvent
9. Navigate to `/poll/[poll_id]` and verify results shown
10. Test audit page for educational content
